# Ehsan's Blog Frontend

This project is the frontend for my blog website, where you can create your own blogs and view blogs created by other users. I created this website to further my web-dev skills, and had a lot of fun while doing it. Check it out [here](https://ehsan.one/)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technology used
- React, specifically create-react-app as a base
- React Testing Library for unit and integration testing
- Cypress for end to end testing
- JWT for authentication
- Typescript as the main coding language
